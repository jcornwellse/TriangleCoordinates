TriangleCoordinates:

A couple assumptions/limitations made in the creation of my program:

1.) Sizes are limited to increments of 10, as each triangle has a width and height of 10, plus a hypotinuse.

2.) Map size is limited to 100 by 100.

3.) Use the print function for a visualization of the triangle coordinates map.

4.) When entering coordinates, you are entering the 3 sides of a triangle.
	-v1 is always the midpoint, where the right triangle is formed.
	-v2 is always the top left point.
	-v3 is always the bottom right point.

Thanks!
